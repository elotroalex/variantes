At _Variantes_, we are always open to receiving new proposals from students and the general public!

The next issue of _Variantes_ is slated for publication in December, 2025. Students in L4-L5 courses, graduates and the general public can submit their creative work by **June 15, 2025** for consideration for the next issue using the Submission Form below.

Note to faculty: If creative work was assigned this semester, please encourage your students to submit. For Spring, keep the link handy and consider sharing this opportunity with students producing exceptional creative projects.
