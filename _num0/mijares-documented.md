bio: "I was born and raised in MEX. Moved to TX when I was 10, then to CA when I was 12. Then MA for college, and now CT for graduate school. For this and more, I've been lucky. And for no less, I am grateful.

So I can't stay quiet. Not while there are millions of good people in this country who cannot tell their stories. Because they're hiding? Because they're afraid? Because doing so would put them and their families in danger. 

But I can't be too loud. I used to think I deserved a place in this country, but now I realize that I, like those millions of others, have *earned* it.

And must continue to."

I don't know if I should talk about this. We've always been taught to
keep it a secret, right?   
To not tell *anybody*. *Ever*.   
*Mexicano?* Pues sí, pero... ya ni sé qué significa.   
I love telling stories, but... I can't even tell my *own*. 

Pero sabes que? The only papers we need are the ones to write our
stories.   
This is our home too.  

Fuck it   

Supposed to break the cycle, but the only thing we're breaking is our
backs, a story left without a title   
Carry the weight of an imaginary world: the American dream, as seen on
TV, behind the walls   
We only watch it through the window, waiting for the day, looking for
the way not to be the prey   
Cause we know   
The only thing we're free to do is leave. A liberty to fear the white
man, don't be perceived   
Unrepresented. Disoriented, either separated or intimidated, frustrated   

Pero ya es hora que nuestra historia y nuestras voces...   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... estén *documentadas.*   

¡Dale!  

Don't even know where to start. A lot of us didn't even know when we had
to depart, "get in the car"   
To the promised land, holding each other's hands   
But we did not see that we stood on quicksand   

Didn't understand we had escaped, that our parents were afraid   
That one day, it'd be a decade later, hiding away   
From raids, betrayed, our hope decayed, papers delayed, unable to get
paid, portrayed  

As a criminal. Liminal. The words are not subliminal   
An immigrant without a fingerprint, an alien without a status, yeah   
The political apparatus wants to ban us   
Treat us as if they don't need us in the U.S.  

A lie. A nation. But we have to call it *alienation*   
We love, we work, we serve. We die for this country   
But not allowed to *live in it?*  

A la chingada, someone's gotta put it bluntly   

Supposed to break the cycle, but the only thing we're breaking is our
backs, a story left without a title   
Carry the weight of another broken promise: the American dream, as seen
on TV, what did we miss?   
We have to watch out through the window, laboring to stay the fuck out
of the way   
Praying every day not to be the prey. Cause we know   
One man voted in---so millions of people voted out.   
No mames   

And don't give me the bullshit of "just come in the right way"   
You think we had fucking years to just sit and wait?   

There're times I'm able to forget my future is unstable   
To believe in what I do, may be the fable of the fool   
But I still visualize a time, and it'll catch me by surprise   
When I am *sympathized? Romanticized?* No, *legitimized!*   

Nostalgia makes me visit my old home in Mexico. I travel on google maps   
I ask myself, what would've been? But deep within, what I know   
Is that I let go and it let go of me   

Try to wipe my tears, but my eyes are dry   
Gotta find a way to send more paper home, but will I ever reap what I've
sown?   
And I know I'm not alone when I say   
I didn't choose to be brought here, but I'm choosing to stay   

Supposed to break the cycle, but the only thing we're breaking is our
backs, a story left without a title   
We carry the weight of an unwritten tragedy: the American dream, as seen
on TV... that's history   
They say the wall was never finished, but I see the truth, unusual and
cruel, working families into custody. Call it a "detention center"   

But I see *cages.*   
And I see *children.*   
Put that shit on the record, man, that's why I'm writing these pages. 

Pero bueno, ya estamos aquí, ¿verdad? Ya no hay de otra.   
Llegamos aquí to stay, mi gente. We've earned our place. We build it
every day, todos los días. Cansados, pero pues... no hemos terminado.   

Yo, la verdad, tuve bastante suerte, y estoy bien agradecido   
Y no es que sea fuerte, pero el dolor algo me ha traído   
Porque vengo convencido, que esto es merecido   

Ya sé, ya sé... me van a decir que el único papel   
que necesito, es el blanco de mi piel   
¡Pero ni que fuera ciudadanía!   
Ahí les va la mía   

No me acuerdo cuando fue que me di cuenta que la vida iba a ser más
difícil   
Yo pensaba que el trabajo duro daba futuro seguro   
Pero si algo el pasado me ha demostrado   
La mejor manera de hacer a dios reír en tener un plan-  

-tados los pies, pero mucho hemos batallado. Con la lana, con la casa,
con comida, y eso deja sus heridas y ansiedades. Pero mis padres hace
mucho que ya me convencieron que   
No hay de otra que echarle a chingazos   
Por más que te duela el corazón-  

-reír es fácil, con tantas malas noticias, hay que   
aceptar que lo único justo es la injusticia   
Madrugado y no ayudado, but I gave myself amnesia   
Rómpeme mi pride, because ya me puse las pilas   
Imagining donde estaría si   
no hubiera sido minoría, cuánto   
tiempo más me quedaría, what   
a pinche gasto de energía   
always failing to meet the criteria   
esta no es alegoría, no   
tendría esta sabiduría, pero tampoco la necesitaría   

Pero a la vida le digo "gracias," y la pendeja me dice "de nada"   
Cause if it wasn't for my situation, yo no tendría tantas metas soñadas   
Olvidada, pero cantada. Una ironía encontrada   
¡Una comedia bien sazonada!  

¡I look back and see, una aventura tras de mi! 

Llena de fracasos, de achievements, y de lágrimas   
But don't give me your lástima, I just need community   
Porque hay que estar unidos, en los estados unidos   
This camino, my destino   

Neta, quién sabe dónde voy a acabar, wey.   
But I'm gonna go far. Va a ser un buen lugar.   
I'll call it my *hogar*.   
As long as I got my guitar.  

Once upon a time, había un oficial del ICE, y tenía detenido a un amigo
mío.   
Y le dijo, "We're just doing our job, hombre."   
Y sabes qué le dijo mi amigo?   
"Me too, Mr. Officer."  

Damn.   

I hope I break the cycle, cause the only thing I'm breaking is my back,
a story *not* without a title   
I'll carry the weight of one more possibility: the American dream, as
seen on TV. It's archetypal   

We're not your   
poor   
but we are your tired   
Inspired masses yearning to breathe free, not to be   
Refugees inside our own home   
We are the hopeful. Hard workers, with ardor. Not beggars, go-getters   
Tempest-tossed to you   
Looking up to the wall from within, wonder when we'll have the path to
begin   
A mighty people whose pain's undocumented but   

With silent lips, I will cry to explain.  

Not just about the wealth we can bring to this place   
After all, somebody's cashing in at the detention gates   
It's about letting la *raza* openly embrace   
The United States   

And yeah, maybe I'm paradoxically   
blindly propagating it, the very same misguided ideology   
That put me in this immigrant predicament. I'm innocent   
Or maybe I'm just another instrument 

But I guess time will tell   
Nuestra historia will dispel   
Porque esta no es farewell   

Somos thinkers, storytellers, teachers, y artistas.   
But we're also constructores, cocineros, agricultores, perfeccionistas.   
Porque lo que *más* queremos... is to have a *home*   
And call it what it is  

Build a future for la *familia*   

*That's* the truth that I want for our youth.   

Órale, pues. Ya estamos
