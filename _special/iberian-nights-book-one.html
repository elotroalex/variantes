      <h2>Yale University | Fall 2023</h2>

      <p>
        This series is inspired by the spirit of Sheherazade, Dhuoda, Christine
        de Pizan, Teresa de Cartagena, the pequeñas mujeres rojas and so many
        others for whom the practice of literature—in many of its facets—was the
        matter of survival. They existed in circumstances of physical and sexual
        violence, of civil war, of racial discrimination, of isolation; they
        also lived in circumstances that cannot be properly expressed outside
        their own experiments with literature.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our guests write from many directions, for many audiences, for many
        souls. Novels, reviews, the lives of afrodescendent people, dance, race,
        sexual violences, asylum briefs, and so many other forms of polyhedric
        writing that explore the limits of literature—and those of survival.
        They will be in conversation about their work, about their thought and,
        certainly, about the joys and frustrations of the literary worlds they
        inhabit.
