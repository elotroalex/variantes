        Celestina used to work within a network of people with varied skills.
        Most of the living ones (I’ll make an exception of Sempronio) are
        lowlives, opportunists, or oppressed individuals with little agency of
        their own.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among the people in this web, a dead one excels. Claudina, Pármeno’s
        mother, was (still is, in her memory) Celestina’s soulmate. Beyond
        anything else, they have been master witches. They are members of the
        craft, of an unofficial guild of highly skilled artists who live a life
        of danger and dispossession, but whose work cannot be more central to
        the economy of relations taking place in both rural and urban centers.
        They are an <em>infra</em> structure.

        The craft —let’s just call it The Craft— is a connective tissue within
        social and political networks. It is also not possible to disentangle it
        from law and religion in those connective, tender tissues of the social
        fabric. The Craft is part of the History of the Book, Archival
        procedures, and documentary poetics. The Craft needs to be addressed
        from a constellation of perspectives that includes gender, queer, trans,
        race, disabilities, and every single one of their possible
        intersections. The Craft defies periodization, the same it defies and
        even challenges the historical need to set borderlines that are
        national, imperial, linguistic, religious. The Craft is linked to
        inquisitorial colonialism and to its dissidence. The Craft is so
        powerful it does not even need to exist to be a transforming element of
        society and politics.

        The purpose of this colloquium is to share investigation across many
        fields and academic interests about the practices and cultures of
        witchcraft.
      </p>
      <p>
        The colloquium on <em>The Craft</em> will consist of a group of people
        working together for two days from different perspectives on the
        practices and theories of Witchcraft. The material will be organized
        around the work of five speakers:
      </p>
      <p>Lexie Cook (University of Durham, UK)</p>
      <p>Soazick Kerneis (Université de Paris, Nanterre)</p>
      <p>Julie Stone Peters (Columbia University)</p>
      <p>Paola Uparela (University of Florida)</p>
      <p>Kaiama Glover (Yale University)</p>
      <p>Proposals:</p>
      <p>
        Please send your proposals with the attached form, which is
        self-explanatory. You can suggest:
      </p>
      <p>-a talk (15 minutes)</p>
      <p>-a lightning talk (3 minutes, fun)</p>
      <p>-a poster</p>
      <p>-an exhibit, either virtual or physical</p>
      <p>
        We will ask for the text of your contributions to be sent at least two
        weeks before the colloquium, so that other participants can read it and
        contribute to the debate in an informed and engaged way. This will also
        limit presentation times, and will foster longer discussions.
        Organization of each panel will be related to the way in which proposals
        converse with one another.
      </p>
      <p>Mini-grants:</p>
      <p>
        Iberian Connections and The Creative Forum will offer 6 $500 mini-grants
        to graduate students, independent and early-career colleagues. Please

        a mini-grant.
