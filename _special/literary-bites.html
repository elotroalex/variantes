      <h2>Yale University | Fall 2024â€“Spring 2025</h2>

      <p>Feast your mind and spirit on a delectable fusion of literature and intellectual nourishment with "Literary Bites," a Luncheon Series presented by the Creative Forum at Yale's Department of Spanish and Portuguese. We will bring together talented writers, scholars, and students for a unique fusion of literary discourse and intellectual stimulation. At these monthly catered lunches, we aim to serve up thought-provoking conversations about past and ongoing projects, showcase Yale's established and up-and-coming literary talents, and strive to transform our department into a thriving hub for literary creation.</p>

      <p>Each of our events revolves around the work of one or a few hosts. Each invited host is in charge of providing us with a twist on the traditional writing workshop or literary reading. In other words, each lunch comes with a plot twist! Come join us for a literary spread that will leave you savoring every word.</p>
