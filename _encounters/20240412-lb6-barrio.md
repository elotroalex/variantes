Explore the narratives woven into everyday objects and the secrets hidden within family albums. Join us as we delve into the stories these objects hold, revealing insights into our lives and identities. In this workshop, Spanish novelist Marta Barrio will share reflections from her latest novel (No volver√°n tus ojos a mirarme) and guide us through the art of writing from materiality.

Marta Barrio is a Spanish author born in the USA. She has published three novels and she is the youngest recipient ever of the Tusquets prize.
