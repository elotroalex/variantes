Please join us for a discussion with Carolyn Fornoff (Cornell University) about her book _Subjunctive Aesthetics: Mexican Cultural Production in the Era of Climate Change_ (Vanderbilt UP, 2024). During the twenty-first century, Mexico has escalated extractive concessions at the same time that it has positioned itself as an international leader in the fight against climate change. Cultural production emergent from this contradiction frames this impasse as a crisis of imagination. In _Subjunctive Aesthetics_, Carolyn Fornoff studies how contemporary writers, filmmakers, and visual artists grapple with the threat that climate change and extractivist policies pose to Mexico's present and future. It explores how artists rise to the challenge of envisioning alternative forms of territoriality (ways of being in relation to the environment) through strategies ranging from rewriting to counterfactual speculation.
