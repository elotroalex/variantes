“Historia de boca en boca” is a literary workshop that proudly assumes the
form of a sobremesa, sharing our thoughts and personal experiences right after lunch.
Together, we will propose different thought-provoking historical events from the last 25
years and write paragraphs that encapsulate the excitement, fear, astonishment, or any
other kind of reaction or anecdote we have treasured over time. Challenging the
distinction between literature and historicity, attendees will integrate their voices into a
choir of personal experiences, creating collective stories that will later be edited and
shared in the Creative Forum. This workshop is a memory game, come play with us.
