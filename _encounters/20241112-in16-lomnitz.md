We invite you to join us for an Iberian Night with renowned scholar Claudio Lomnitz to discuss the ideas and work behind his new book _Sovereignty and Extortion: A New State Form in Mexico._

### Preparing for the Evening

Attached you should find four readings: Two chapters---1 and 5---from the new book _Sovereignty and Extortion: A New State Form in Mexico_, a recent interview Lomnitz conducted on this topic in the _New York Review of Books_, and a review by Lomnitz (also published in the NYRB) of Marcela Turati’s book on the San Fernando massacre. The latter may be optional reading, although it helps to understand something of what motivated the formation of the Social Study of Disappearance Lab that Lomnitz set up at Columbia, which he will be talking about with us.
