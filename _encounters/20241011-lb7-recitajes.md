_Recitaje_ is a literary workshop on expanded poetry. Alongside Luis Prieto and Marcos García Barrero, participants will practice writing a performance text. We will also explore the relationship between the word and the body through contemplative meditation and improvisation. Participants are invited to approach poetry from an awareness of their body and a performance of cotidian gestures.

_Recitaje_ es un taller de poesía expandida donde practicamos la creación del texto para performance. También exploramos la relación entre la palabra y el cuerpo a través de la meditación contemplativa y la improvisación. Invitamos a las/los participantes al trabajo poético desde el cuerpo y desde el gesto cotidiano.

## Sobre los facilitadores

**Luis Prieto** is a PhD student in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese at Yale University. He studies Latin American art, history, and philosophy, with a special focus on Caribbean cultural and literary studies. His research interests also include Latinx art and activism, diaspora and migration studies, and political and economic theory. Before joining Yale, he completed his MA in Spanish Literatures, Cultures and Languages at the University of Connecticut. He has collaborated as a writer with El Estornudo, a Cuban digital magazine of narrative journalism. His interview with the Ay Ombe Theatre group, “LLegó el dulce. Ay Ombe Theatre y Performance Autology. Cuido y comunidad,” is forthcoming from Candela Review: afro-trans-queer-feminista-descolonial.

**Marcos García Barrero** is a versatile Spanish actor, singer, author, and educator, with a distinguished career in the performing arts and literature. He studied acting at RESAD (Royal Drama School of Madrid) and is currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Hispanic Studies Department at the University of Connecticut (UConn). Additionally, he holds a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature from the Autonomous University of Madrid.

As a professional actor and playwright, Marcos has participated in over thirty theater productions across Spain and internationally, performing at renowned venues such as the Henley Festival in London, the CIFET Festival in Cairo, the Contemporary Stage Festival in Madrid, and the Volksbühne Theater in Berlin. Marcos is also an accomplished poet and videopoet, having been a finalist in the III Premio Nacional de Poesía Viva #LdeLírica in 2021 and the III Concurso Internacional de Videopoemas POEX 24 with his work Si un salto en el tiempo.

In recent years, he has focused on teaching voice and oral poetry composition, building on the principles developed in his unique stage poetry performances. Two of his notable shows, Uno dos, Estrella and Delirios de un figurante, have been published as books—Uno dos, Estrella by Libros.com and Delirios de un figurante by Bajamar Editores. The latter was performed in 2023 in Madrid with experimental guitarist Fernando López-Andujar and in 2024 at the Museo Barjola de Gijón in collaboration with jazz musician Carmen Miranda.
