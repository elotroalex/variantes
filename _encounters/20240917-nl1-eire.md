In our first entry of our new Neighbor Lunches series, we will be catching up with affiliate faculty Carlos Eire (History). Carlos will discuss his most recent paper "Avatar of the Impossible: Sor María de Ágreda and her _History of the Virgin_", which will appear soon in a collection of essays on _Women of the Book_. Join us for a lively discussion and a chance to catch up with Carlos and his work. Lunch will be provided.

Welcome to the Creative Forum, Carlos!
