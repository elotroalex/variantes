Club Venezuela and Oye! Spoken Word invite you to a lunch full of creativity creating a collage and writing a poem related to Venezuela and its culture! Laura Guerra-Lopez, Isa Dom√≠nguez, Nicole Viloria, and others will guide you with clippings of Venezuelan elements for you to create your collage and will give you a writing prompt for your poems! We will listen to music, share ideas, and read our poems at the end!
